
Q: Is there a way to create a stand-alone VPython application?

A: From Andrei Makhanov, for Windows:

1) To compile a vPython program to exe, you need to download py2exe and install it.
    There exists a Python 2.7.3 version.

2) py2exe require msvcp90.dll to be installed, which is a Microsoft distribution.
    Find the .dll online and put it into C:\Python27\DLLs.

3) Edit C:\\Python27\Lib\site-packages\visual_common\materials.py with VIDLE.

4) In materials.py, find texturepath. Find where it says "visual\\" and change it to "".

5) Create a file called setup.py containing the following (change the name "stars.py" to your py file):

from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe

setup(
console = ["stars.py"],
)

Alternatively, you can use the file setup.py, in which case
you don't need to perform step 8 below. You will need to change 
the "script" option to replace the name "stars.py" with the name of your own file.

6) Place the files setup.py and stars.py (or your file name) in a folder that's easy to get to.

7) In a command prompt, go to this folder and execute the following code:
    C:\Python27\python setup.py py2exe

8) From C:\\Python27\Lib\site-packages\visual_common copy the following files to your folder:
    turbulence3.tga, wood.tga, BlueMarble.tga, brickbump.tga, earth.tga, and random.tga.

9) The program should now execute and work.
